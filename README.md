# SysFlow

**SysFlow** is a web app for **plural systems**—people who experience more than one sense of self or identity within one body—often in the context of **[dissociative identity disorder (DID)](https://www.isst-d.org/)** or **other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD)**.

It helps systems **track who is “fronting”** (present and in control), **manage headmate profiles**, and **keep a lightweight journal**—with room to grow.

## What is dissociative identity disorder (DID)?

**DID** is a **trauma-related dissociative disorder**. In DID, a person’s mind may have separated aspects of experience and identity in ways that can feel like **distinct parts** or **identity states** (sometimes called **alters** or **headmates** in community language). These parts are **not** “fake personalities”—they are **real, meaningful aspects of one person’s lived experience**, often shaped by how the mind adapted to overwhelming events.

**OSDD** is another dissociative diagnosis on a similar spectrum; experiences vary widely person to person.

> **Note:** SysFlow is a **tool**, not medical care. It does not diagnose or treat anything. If you’re struggling, consider reaching out to a **trauma-informed** mental health professional.

## Why an app like this?

Many plural systems juggle:

- **Memory gaps or confusion** about who was present when  
- **Co-consciousness** (more than one part aware at once) or **switching**  
- A need to **communicate** inside the system or with trusted people  
- **Safety and privacy** around sensitive history  

A dedicated app can:

- Record **who is fronting** and **for how long** (when the system chooses to log it)  
- Hold **headmate profiles** (names, notes, privacy levels) in one place  
- Support **journaling** and **history** so patterns are easier to see—**on the user’s terms**  

SysFlow is built to respect that **the user decides** what to track and how to name their experience.

## What SysFlow does (today)

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Accounts** | Sign up / sign in with **email & password** or **Google** (OAuth). Data is tied to a **system** workspace in MongoDB. |
| **Dashboard** | Overview and **active front** display with a **timer** for the current front session. |
| **Headmates** | List and manage **headmate** profiles (Mongo-backed when logged in). |
| **Front tracking** | **Add / set / remove** who is fronting; each meaningful change **ends** the previous session and **starts a new** one so you get a **history timeline**. |
| **Front history** | Timeline of past front sessions. |
| **Journal** | **Scaffold** UI for journal entries (mock/sample data in MVP; expandable to full CRUD + privacy rules). |
| **Theme** | **Light / dark** mode and a **teal**-accented palette with semantic colors (e.g. warnings, success). |

The **Express backend** in this repo is a **small health/API scaffold**; most **auth and plural data APIs** run inside the **Next.js** app (API routes + MongoDB).

### Frontend (`frontend/`)

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/app/` | Routes and **server/API route handlers** (`api/auth`, `api/headmates`, `api/front`, …). |
| `src/components/` | Client and shared UI: layout shell, headmates UI, theme toggle, login/signup forms. |
| `src/lib/` | **Mongo connection**, **NextAuth options**, **front session actions**, seed/mock helpers. |
| `src/models/` | **Mongoose** schemas for users, systems, headmates, front sessions. |

### Backend (`backend/`)

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/index.ts` | Express server (e.g. **health check**); optional separate service from the Next app. |

---

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (LTS recommended)  
- **MongoDB** (e.g. [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))  

### Frontend (primary app)

1. `cd frontend`  
2. `npm install`  
3. Copy `.env.example` → `.env.local` and set at least:
   - **`MONGODB_URI`** — required for signup/login and plural data (Next.js talks to Mongo directly).  
   - **`NEXTAUTH_SECRET`**, **`NEXTAUTH_URL`**  
   - Optional: **`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`**, **`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`** for Google sign-in  
4. `npm run dev` — uses **Webpack** (see `frontend/README.md` for why).  
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Backend (optional scaffold)

1. `cd backend`  
2. `npm install`  
3. Copy `.env.example` → `.env` (Mongo URI if you use the health route)  
4. `npm run dev`  

Health check (default): `http://localhost:4000/api/health`
